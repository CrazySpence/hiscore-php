# hiscore-php

The purpose of this software is to display 1942, Galaga, Ms Pacman and Pacman hiscore data from MAME hiscore 
files to a local website.

I created the pacman and galaga functions somewhere around 2000 as a demo of it being possible then never touched
the software again until recently when my work office got an Arcade cab. Someone had beaten my Galaga score so I
decided to ressurect my old software and create a sort of bragging portal for the office to spur competition.

# Setup
Install a webserver of choice and PHP on your arcade system and edit index.php. Change the paths to your games 
hiscore files.
